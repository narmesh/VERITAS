# Veritas - The Truth Beneath

**Veritas** is a visually striking, immersive news webpage designed to provide not only the headlines, but the full context—allowing users to explore the truth beneath each story.

## 🌐 Overview

Veritas offers a modern, responsive layout for a news/media website with a unique "truth lens" feature that reveals a secondary narrative behind a featured article. It leverages HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to deliver a dynamic, interactive experience without any frameworks.

## 🎯 Features

- **Truth Lens Reveal**: A circular magnifier follows the user's cursor, unveiling the hidden "truth" version of a featured article.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully adaptive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Category-Based Sections**: Includes Politics, Economy, Technology, Health, Science, and more.
- **Trending & Editor’s Picks**: Highlights of the most important and popular content.
- **Newsletter Subscription UI**: A call-to-action area to collect user emails.
- **Interactive UI Elements**:
  - Breaking news ticker
  - Hoverable news cards
  - Instruction modal with toggles
- **Dark Aesthetic Theme**: Modern design using custom CSS variables for dark mode visuals.
